👋 Apa khabar semua 👋

I build Rails app for organizations that want to streamline their operations digitally. 

🔧 I’m currently maintaining:
- [Ticket Flow](https://ticketflow.app/) - An Issue tracker for manufacturers that provide:
  - In house repairs that requires a Returm Material Authorization (RMA)
  - Onsite repairs with Work Order 
  - Standard parts sale with a quotation
- Document Center -  A static website with no DB that containes multiple repair procedures behind a basic authentication.
- Rekon - A report generator that gets raw data from [Bukku Cloud Accounting](https://bukku.my/) software. 

👨‍💻 I’m currently working on:
1. imbas - Invoice and receipt reader that automatically categorizes and save it to Bukku Cloud Accounting Software
2. otoku - A Car app
3. PIBG - Schools and parents to track PIBG payments and due amount, simply

⚡ Would like to colab:

I like to ride bikes 🚴‍♂️ and I would love to build a Pump Track. So if you have a similar interest and live in Nilai, Malaysia, let's get in touch maybe we can get Velo Solutions to build one here 😁
